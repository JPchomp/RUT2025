## RECODING URBAN TRANSPORTATION 2025

A regional Public Goods Initiative from the Inter-American Development Bank seeking to promote growth through digitization

### Why this initiative?

Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries suffer cross cutting problems:

- Rapid urbanization
- Sprawling development patterns
- Rapid motorization 
- Deepening income inequality and poverty 

These are partially heightened by existing transportation conditions that structurally hold back the region:

- Presence of large informal systems 
- High levels of negative environmental and traffic safety externalities
- Formal transit systems that suffer from low service quality and/or efficiencies, 
- Lack of adequate and affordable coverage in low income areas

We believe modern technology has the potential to alleviate these problems in the long run, but require shifting towards an equity oriented approach before being translated to the region.

### What is RUT2025

Recoding Urban Transport 2025 (RUT2025) is a regional hub between public institutions, public transit and technology companies to harness the potential of technology/digital solutions to reduce poverty and inequality in the region through sustainable mobility. 
Among its initiatives are:

#### Creation of prototypes and testbeds for shared mobility 

Shared mobility options are becoming increasingly popular in mobility discussions given their role bridging the gap between private and public transportation systems. These systems combine a variety of features that fill a niche in the urban transportation landscape: they free the user from owning and maintaining vehicles, they provide a high level of point-to-point access and use innovative smartphone apps to bring more information to the user. Technology has aided tremendously in making these systems viable and efficient: On the user side the process of assigning vehicles and drivers to users when requested, finding the best route between origin and destination, gauging user experience; likewise on the supply side the driver hiring and payment, pricing management and fleet control, has been made possible on real-time thanks to the ubiquity of technology. 
With the LAC region only beginning to experience the changes brought about by this revolution, testbeds and propotypes focused on harnessing this technology to improve access and equity for lower income groups are paramount to ensure these efficiencies transfer across society.

#### Partnerships between shared mobility providers and governments

The introduced shared mobility strategies promise making enhancing mobility in the region. In LAC Moovit, Via,  Ualabee, and Uber among others are positioning themselves to integrate data and platforms, enabling users to perform trips combining mass transit and other shared alternatives in a regular fashion. These alternatives, although not already completely mature, promise to transform mobility as we know it. The main driver of these innovations in the conceptions of urban transportation have been Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) also known as ride-hailing. Since their inception a vertiginous scale up has taken place and their business models replicated in other services. Similarly, their regulatory and equity challenges have also been experienced by many of these providers. 
Ensuring a space for dialogue and sharing of protocols accross countries of the region, combining the participation of private companies is a must to have a smooth transition into tech-driven mobility. Succesful experiences do exist, and they have all required the coordination of existing systems to find synergies. Making these networks faster is key to reap the benefits of shared mobility sooner. 

#### Manual and tools for mapping informal services 

Mapping urban transport constitutes an innovative approach in the production of open data regarding transit services, especially in cities where there is a lack of information regarding transportation services, and high levels of informality in the transportation sector and urban growth dynamics. Mapping methodologies are emerging not only as a way to generate origin and destination data, reducing the costs of extensive survey studies, but also to generate open data, which is available to the public. Open data not only increases availability of information for citizens, but also fosters transparency, economic integration of SMEs, entrepreneurship and better decision-making.
